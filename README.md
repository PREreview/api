## About PREreview
PREreview is an open project that operates as a non-profit organization via fiscal sponsorship of Code for Science and Society. PREreview’s mission is to bring more diversity and equity to scholarly peer review by supporting and empowering researchers to review preprints, in particular early-career researchers from groups underrepresented in scholarship.
PREreview is also a platform for the crowdsourcing of preprint reviews.

Registered users via ORCID API can:
* Request a review on a preprint
* Fill out and submit a rapid review—12 yes/no/not sure/n.a. questions designed to capture the essence of the preprint
* Compose a long-form review on a preprint, alone or in collaboration with other reviewers
* Comment on others’ reviews
* Endorse others’ reviews via Plaudit
* Flag others’ reviews as violating our Code of Conduct
* Engage with communities

Anyone who lands on the page can:
* Search for preprints that have reviews or requests for reviews on our site
* Read and sort through aggregated rapid reviews next to the preprint
* Read and sort through long-form reviews next to the preprint

PREreview is not a preprint server, but fetches the metadata and pdf (when openly licensed) of a preprint for which a user wants to submit a review or a request for review from Google Scholar. Our goal is to provide a way for any preprint from any existing preprint server to be reviewed by any community member willing to be constructive. 
The source code for the platform and can be found [here](https://github.com/PREreview/prereview).
